# Telegram Powershell Hack Tool
This is an open source hack tool that helps you to execute powershell commands from your Telegram Bot
## why TPHackTool?
well this amazing tool, helps you to execute any powershell command on the target computer and since telegram is almost a secure channel to communicate, we can use telegram bots for 	
communicat with our script to control target computer


**Note : you can use just one Bot to communicat with all of your targets**


> To communicate with bot, we use `HttpRequest` from .NET library, so it will be supported by powershell 2.0 and lower versions



## To Setup


we are going to do this :

At the first, we should change Execution Policy by executeing `mainForRunOnFlash.bat`. it will change Execution Policy to `Bypass`
then the bat file will execute `mainForRunOnFlash.ps1`



**Note: to execute  `mainForRunOnFlash.ps1`, you should have `BatForShortcutToRunMainScriptonTarget.bat` and `mainScript.ps1` besid**


## TODO :

1.  Find a way to execute from a flash drive automaticly
2.  Just use it to find bugs
